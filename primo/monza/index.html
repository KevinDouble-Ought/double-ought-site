<!--
  index.html
  ==========
  This is the "front door" of your app.
  When you open Monza in a browser, this file loads first.

  It does 3 main things:
  1) Defines the page structure (HTML)
  2) Pulls in the styling (CSS)
  3) Pulls in the behavior/logic (JavaScript)

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
  <!--
    The <head> section contains page metadata and links to resources.
    Users don't see this content directly.
  -->

  <!-- Character encoding so text displays correctly -->
  <meta charset="UTF-8" />

  <!-- This shows in the browser tab -->
  <title>Monza – Bocce Bracket</title>

  <!--
    Link to your CSS file.
    This tells the browser: "apply styles from styles/main.css"
    The path is relative to index.html (same folder as index.html).
  -->
  <link rel="stylesheet" href="styles/main.css" />
</head>

<body>
  <!--
    The <body> section is what users actually see.
  -->

  <!-- Main page heading -->
  <h1>Monza</h1>

  <!-- A short description of what Phase 1 is -->
  <p>Phase 1 – Single Elimination</p>

  <!--
    This is the “mount point” for your app.
    JavaScript will locate this element by its id ("app")
    and insert content inside it.
  -->
  <div id="app"></div>

  <!--
    Load your JavaScript LAST (at the end of body) on purpose.

    Why?
    - The browser reads top-to-bottom.
    - If JS runs before the page exists, document.getElementById("app")
      could return null (meaning: "I couldn't find it yet").
    - Loading at the end means the page is already built by the time JS runs.

  <script src="scripts/app.js"></script>
