Errors
    Should the "bye" from the last round get first "match" in the next round? Basically potentially re-seeding each round???




Ideas (bigger things)
    undo for assigning match winners/losers
    put current win/loss record into the bracket boxes





Enhancements (smaller things)
    Double-ought logo
    independent vertical scrolliong for "teams" section and "bracket" section
    After clicking wins/losses, the bracket doesn't re-center
    trademark / legal language at bottom in fine print
